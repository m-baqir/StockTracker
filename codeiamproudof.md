please check out my other repositories for projects i've worked on in the recent past.
- [Used car sale app](https://github.com/m-baqir/UsedCarApp)
- This was an app I built as a project for class. Basically a copy of the autotrader website where users can create ads and post their vehicle for sale.
- [Ticket messaging App](https://github.com/m-baqir/TicketMessagingApp)
- This was a ticket messaging system, can be used for tech support as an example. Where the  user and admin can communicate with chat functionality based on what issue the user is facing. has login functionality and uses XML to pull data from instead of db.
- [Knight's Club a social media platform](https://github.com/m-baqir/Knights-Club) 
- This is a group project we did. Built a social media platform with user profiles, friend requests, image galleries, community blog, subscription with paypal integration and other features.

Please keep in mind these projects are a work in progress. Aside from these projects, I am also working on my own portfolio website which should be ready in the next few weeks.
